# AntAlgorithm

AntAlgorithm is a C++ implementation of the ant colony algorithm using Qt. The project is aimed at solving optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph.

## Description

The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the behavior of ants when searching for shortest routes. The project demonstrates the application of this algorithm to solve graph-related problems, such as the traveling salesman problem.

## Main features

- Implementation of the ant colony algorithm.
- Visualization of the graph and the optimization process.
- Setting algorithm parameters such as the number of ants, pheromone evaporation coefficients and intensity.

## Installation
